# A few words about project

Do you also use someone else's Netflix account? Well, I do. But what if I forgot my password and I want to log into Netflix on my girlfriend's computer? Then there is a problem because I have to call my brother, he has to look for a login and password, and if it goes well, I can watch my favorite series within half an hour. But what if I wanted to avoid this problem? Obviously, I can use the password manager in my browser, but sometimes I don't think it can remember the passwords I use between other devices. This is why I wrote a simple password manager with GUI created in Tkinter, that saves data locally to SQLite database using SQLAlchemy module. I can keep such a database file in the cloud and, if necessary, I have quick access to it from someone's computer.

# Instruction
Just run *keeper_with_GUI.py* file
